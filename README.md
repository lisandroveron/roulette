# Russian Roulette

The Russian Roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, killing or severely injuring the player.

## Rules
In each turn, the player will have 2 options: trigger the gun himself, or trigger to the other.

If the player decide to trigger himself but the gun doesn't fire, the game will go to the next turn.

But if he decides to trigger to the other player and the gun doesn't fire, the player is forced to trigger himself before the game goes to the next turn.

The gun has a certain number of slots (in this case, it is assumed to be a revolver with 6 bullets) and the bullet can be in any of them (determined at random).

If the gun shoots you, the game is over and there is a winner (Spoiler: You aren't).
